my working and learning notes for the summer23 internship @Caterpillar

## ruby language notes
- puts vs. print
  - difference: `puts "hello wolrd"` == print "hello world\n"
  - common: would return nil
- puts vs. p
  - difference: p would return the parameter string
  - common: the output to the console would be the same, i.e., with new line character
- define a method
  ```
  def say_hello(name)
    puts name
  end

  say_hello "Edison"
  ```
